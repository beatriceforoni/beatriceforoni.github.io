I obtained my PhD in Models for Economics and Finance in 2023 at the
<a href='https://www.uniroma1.it/'>Sapienza University of Rome</a>
(Italy) with a thesis on Hidden Markov models for time series data
analysis. I am one of the members of the <a
href='https://quantileregressionlab.github.io/'> Quantile Regression
Lab</a> and I collaborate with national and international
institutions, including the  <a href='https://www.mcgill.ca//'>McGill
University</a> (Canada), and the <a
href='https://www.uniroma1.it'>Sapienza University of Rome</a>
(Italy). From 2023 to 2024 I was a postdoctoral researcher in
statistics at the MEMOTEF Department of Sapienza University of Rome
(Italy).Right now, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the MEMOTEF
Department of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy). My research interests lie in quantile regression, Hidden Markov models, random forest and graphical models with applications to time series and correlated data.
